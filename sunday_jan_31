Challenge:

Given the file named "urls.txt" that contains a list of URLs, you need to parse the file, extract and display all the domains.
For example:
  URL: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/skype.exe
  Domain: www.microsoft.com

This will be accomplished using nodejs. Your js program will be saved to a file called parser.js.
You will run the program using the following command:
  nodejs parser.js
